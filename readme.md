# My random pieces of code

Here are some random pieces of code, tools, and scripts. They are too small to be a separated repository.  
If no specified, all codes are under Apache License, Version 2.0.  
Each folder is one piece of code.

The folder name contains the programming language, and something about what the code does.

Code piece list by folder:

**js-reddit-post-monitor**  
A single HTML page with some JavaScript, which monitor certain subreddits on Reddit.

**mt4-nsis-installer**  
A very simple NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) script to create Windows installer for MetaTrader 4 Expert Advisors and Indicators.
